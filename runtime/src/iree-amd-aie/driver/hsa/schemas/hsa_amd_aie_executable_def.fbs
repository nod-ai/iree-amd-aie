  // ELF for AIE tiles and embedded processors like Microblaze.

  // IP layout of instantiated peripherals and compute kernels, 
  // clocking details and kernel connectivity for each compute kernel.

  // programming the hardware and initializing key data structures in XRT userspace libraries and XRT kernel drivers.
