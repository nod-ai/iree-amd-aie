  //   - The second dimension represents the number of kernel runs per entry point.
  //     The size is computed as `1 + 2 * num_reconfiguration`, where:
  //       - The base kernel run is always present.
  //       - Each reconfiguration requires two additional kernel runs:
  //         - One for the configuration.
  //         - One for the actual execution after reconfiguration.
  //   - The third dimension is a uint32 array containing the instruction stream for a single kernel run.

  // - If an index is `-1`, it indicates that no reconfiguration is required for the corresponding entry point.
  //   This is a workaround, as `reconf_data_runlists` does not support null elements.

  //   - The first dimension corresponds to entry points that require reconfiguration.
  //     - Its size is smaller than `entry_points` because not all entry points require reconfiguration.
  //     - Null elements are not supported in flattenbuffer, so only entries with reconfiguration are included.
  //   - The second dimension represents the number of reconfiguration sequences per entry point.
  //   - The third dimension contains a uint32 array with control packet data required for a single reconfiguration.
