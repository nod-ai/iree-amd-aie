# Codeowners for IREE-AMD-AIE Github Repository.
# The listed owners will automatically be added as reviewers to PRs that modify
# paths matching the specified patterns.
# Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
# for syntax of this file (tl;dr: syntax is like .gitignore. Last matching rule
# takes precedence).
# Because of the precedence, rules for directories are listed topologically.
# @ghost is used to make a pattern have no owners. It is a sentinel GitHub user
# that takes the place of deleted users.

# No global owners because we don't really want e.g. changing the root
# CMakeLists.txt file to always ping a bunch of people.
