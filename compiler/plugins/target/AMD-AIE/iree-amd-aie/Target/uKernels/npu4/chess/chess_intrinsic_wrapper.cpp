// Description from there follows:

// This file contains symbols that are used in Chess compilation to implement
// intrinsics.  It tries to solve the problem that the Chess compiler does not
// implement 'standard' llvm intrinsics (which contain '.') as a separator.
// Rather than implement a fragile mechanism that relies on a particular
// encoding this file is compiled with the Chess compiler to generate the
// proper encoding and then this file is linked with code generated with
// llvm-style intrinsics. Note that the Chess frontend replaces '.' with '___'
// when parsing .ll code containing standard intrinsic names, so these symbols
// are defined that way.
